# [Ceramic](http://ceramic.github.io/)

Common Lisp web apps on the desktop.

## Overview

Ceramic takes an ordinary Common Lisp web app, and bundles it into an executable
you can distribute, so your users can install it and run the app and server in a
dedicated desktop window like any other app.

See the [documentation](http://ceramic.github.io/docs/introduction.html).
